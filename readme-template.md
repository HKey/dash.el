# <img align="right" src="https://raw.github.com/magnars/dash.el/master/rainbow-dash.png"> dash.el

A modern list API for Emacs.  No
[`'cl`](https://gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/cl/) required.

## Installation

It's available on [GNU ELPA](https://elpa.gnu.org/) and
[MELPA](https://melpa.org/):

    M-x package-install dash

Or you can just dump `dash.el` in your `load-path` somewhere.

If you want the function combinators, then also:

    M-x package-install dash-functional

## Using in a package

Add something like this to the [library's
headers](https://gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Library-Headers.html):

    ;; Package-Requires: ((dash "[[ version ]]"))

To get function combinators:

    ;; Package-Requires: ((dash "[[ version ]]") (dash-functional "1.3.0"))

## Upcoming breaking change!

- For backward compatibility reasons, `-zip` when called with two
  lists returns a list of cons cells, rather than a list of proper
  lists.  This is a clunky API, and may be changed in a future release
  to always return a list of proper lists, as `-zip-lists` currently
  does.

  **N.B.:** Do not rely on the current behavior of `-zip` for two
  lists.  Instead, use `-zip-pair` for a list of cons cells, and
  `-zip-lists` for a list of proper lists.

## Fontification of special variables

Font lock of special Dash variables (`it`, `acc`, etc.) in Emacs Lisp
buffers can optionally be enabled with the autoloaded minor mode
`dash-fontify-mode`.  In older Emacs versions which do not dynamically
detect macros, the minor mode also fontifies Dash macro calls.

To automatically enable the minor mode in all Emacs Lisp buffers, just
call its autoloaded global counterpart `global-dash-fontify-mode`,
either interactively or from your `user-init-file`:

```el
(global-dash-fontify-mode)
```

## Functions

All functions and constructs in the library use a dash (`-`) prefix.

The library also provides anaphoric macro versions of functions where
that makes sense.  The names of these macros are prefixed with two
dashes (`--`) instead of one.

While `-map` applies a function to each element of a list, its
anaphoric counterpart `--map` evaluates a form with the local variable
`it` temporarily bound to the current list element instead.  For
example:

```el
(-map (lambda (n) (* n n)) '(1 2 3 4)) ; Normal version.
(--map (* it it) '(1 2 3 4))           ; Anaphoric version.
```

The normal version can of course also be written as follows:

```el
(defun my-square (n)
  "Return N multiplied by itself."
  (* n n))

(-map #'my-square '(1 2 3 4))
```

This demonstrates the utility of both versions.

## Contribute

Yes, please do.  Pure functions in the list manipulation realm only,
please.  There's a suite of examples/tests in `dev/examples.el`, so
remember to add tests for your additions, or I might break them later.

You'll find the repo at:

    https://github.com/magnars/dash.el

Run the tests with:

    make check

Regenerate the docs with:

    make docs

I highly recommend that you install these as a pre-commit hook, so
that the tests are always running and the docs are always in sync:

    cp pre-commit.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit

Oh, and don't edit `README.md` or `dash.texi` directly; they are
auto-generated.  Change `readme-template.md` or `dash-template.texi`
instead, respectively.

To ensure that `dash.el` can be distributed with GNU ELPA or Emacs, we
require that all contributors assign copyright to the Free Software
Foundation.  For more on this, see [`(info "(emacs) Copyright
Assignment")`](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Copyright-Assignment.html).
